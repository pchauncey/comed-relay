# comed-relay

Turns on and off a raspberry pi relay based on current electricity prices from ComEd, for use with their [hourly pricing](https://hourlypricing.comed.com/live-prices/).

I used this [relay board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CZL2SKN), but any relay controlled by GPIO should work.
